    <h2>About Me</h2>

    <p>
        Hello, my name is Willy. I have lived in Charlotte for most of my live, and I am currently pursuing a Master's degree at
        the <b>University of North Carolina at Charlotte</b>. I also work as a waiter for now, and I strive to become a software developer for a regional company in the near future.
        My hobbies include playing video games and going for walks outside. I am a naturally quiet person but I am open to collaborations and conversations, and I maintain a professional
        attitude during group projects.
