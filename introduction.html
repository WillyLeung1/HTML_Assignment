        <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
        I strive to learn to program as efficiently as possible in the field 
        of <u>data science and analytics</u>, and to professionally cooperate with peers in 
        group projects. Over the years, I have had many experiences programming in
        the following languages:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Java</li>
            <li>Python</li>
            <li>C</li>
            <li>C++</li>
            <li>SQL</li>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        I've also had experiences working with <i>AWS web development</i> and
        video game design in <i>GameMaker Studio</i>.
